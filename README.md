# Calculator optimum coagulant dose
Welcome! [IHE Delft](http://un-ihe.org)
## Introduction
Coagulation is a general treatment method to remove suspended fine particles, colour and other constituents from raw water, after adding chemicals (coagulants) and followed by further treatment. Coagulation is often applied in both conventional and advanced water treatment processes for the production of drinking water. 

Theoretical calculation of the optimum coagulant dose is not possible. Therefore, for each raw water experiments are needed. In glass beakers the coagulation process (rapid mixing, flocculation and sedimentation) is performed as shown in Fiure. This bench scale test is the so called “Jar test”. 

The overall aim of this project is to make an app which allows to analyze the google sheet data generated from the lab jar test experiments and calcualte the optimum coagulant dose. The app also allows the users to eneters the some plant operational data to calculate the total coagulant dose needed.

* [Python3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) was used as a scripting language for the app development in this project.

* [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) was used to flow diagram for the app.

* [Github](https://github.com/) was used to create the repository and to store the cproject's code after pushed from Git.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used as the Code Editor for the site
* [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) tool was used for manual testing procedures for code validation.

* [Ami](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) was used to develop a Mockup screenshot generator
* [Heroku](heroku.com) was used to deploy a final version of the Python Essentials application code.

## PEP8 online validation
  PEP8 online validation tool was used to validate the code to ensure there were no syntax errors or improper code indentation. It passed the test as seen in the screenshot below:
