# Calculator optimum coagulant dose
Welcome! [IHE Delft](http://un-ihe.org)
## Introduction
Globally, degradation of surface water quality due to the presence of physical, chemical and biological impurities is a major issue that makes surface water unsafe to drink. Therefore, treatment of surface water is essential to make it pathogen free, chemically safe, with no dirt solid matter and aesthetically acceptable. In this context, there is a strong need to understand the theoretical aspect of various treatment options, its design principle and operation. Among the various treatment steps, coagulation process is the first steps in the treatment where we add coagulant to agglomerate small particles to larger in order to allow them to settle in the next treatment steps. 

The overall aim of this project is to make quiz app which allows to assess the knowledge of students in the topic of coagulation. This project is the continuation of the first project, which focused on giving theoretical content about the topic.
